# Confidence Scale

**Document type:** Evidence reliability framework  
**Archive designation:** KKA-ARCH-002

---

## Purpose

The **Confidence Scale** defines how strongly an entry reflects verifiable conditions at the Kākāriki Atoll site.

The archive separates observation from interpretation.  
Confidence ratings apply only to the reliability of the claim, not to its importance.

A low-confidence statement may still be significant.

## Rating Levels

### High Confidence

Directly observable and repeatedly verifiable conditions.

Criteria:
- measurable physical features
- consistent results across surveys
- minimal interpretive dependence

Examples:
- location of structures
- material composition
- ash layer distribution
- preserved positions

These entries are unlikely to change except through improved measurement.

---

### Moderate Confidence

Supported by evidence but dependent on incomplete context.

Criteria:
- repeat observations with minor variation
- reasonable inference from physical conditions
- limited alternative explanations

Examples:
- movement pathways
- usage wear
- construction sequence
- environmental effects

These entries may shift with additional discovery.

---

### Low Confidence

Interpretive or fragmentary conclusions.

Criteria:
- incomplete textual sources
- metaphor-dependent translation
- single-instance observation
- competing plausible explanations

Examples:
- belief systems
- symbolic meaning
- cultural intention
- cause attribution

These entries are expected to evolve over time.

---

## Mixed Confidence Entries

Many articles contain multiple confidence levels.  
Each section reflects its own evidence category rather than the page as a whole.

For example:
- a structure's dimensions (High)
- its purpose (Low)

---

## Revision Policy

Confidence ratings may change when:

- new fragments are recovered
- environmental conditions alter interpretation
- independent observations replicate a claim

Earlier ratings remain documented in editorial records.

---

## Reader Guidance

Confidence is not certainty.  
It is a statement about how knowledge was obtained.

Two Low-confidence interpretations may both remain valid simultaneously.
