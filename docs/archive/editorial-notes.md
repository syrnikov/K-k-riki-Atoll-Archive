# Editorial Notes

**Document type:** Ongoing record of interpretive disagreements  
**Archive designation:** KKA-ARCH-003

---

## Purpose

The **Editorial Notes** preserve conflicts, corrections, and unresolved issues encountered during compilation of the Kākāriki Atoll Archive.

Rather than consolidating conclusions, this document records where interpretation diverges.  
Contradictions are retained to prevent later readings from appearing artificially consistent.

---

## Terminology Conflicts

### “Kākāriki”

Recorded meanings include:

- color reference (green)
- ecological vitality
- social identity
- environmental state

The phrase  
> “He kākāriki te whenua” _(the land is green / the land is vital)_  
remains unresolved due to contextual variability across fragments.

---

### “Ahi”

Possible interpretations:

- literal fire
- geothermal heat
- energetic process
- relational condition

In recitations, *ahi* often appears in plural categories, complicating direct translation.

---

## Structural Interpretation Disputes

### Stone Watchers

Competing views:

1. anthropomorphic figures
2. avian figures
3. observational markers
4. non-representational installations

No single explanation accounts for orientation variation.

---

### Tagoror Circles

Debated functions:

- gathering space
- acoustic signaling site
- environmental monitoring position
- governance structure

Acoustic properties are measurable; social usage is not.

---

## Behavioral Interpretation Issues

### Movement Patterns

Corridor wear suggests repeated passage, yet preserved figures do not show organized evacuation.

This creates conflict between:

- routine movement interpretation
- emergency response expectation

---

### Moss Shrines

Deposited objects may represent:

- offerings
- markers
- environmental testing
- incidental placement

Regrowth behavior prevents definitive classification.

---

## Collapse Event Debates

### Warning Awareness

Fragments imply prior discussion of imbalance:

> “Kua rerekē ngā tohu” _(the signs have changed)_

Yet physical evidence suggests minimal coordinated response.

Interpretations:

- warning misunderstood
- warning ignored
- warning unrelated to hazard

---

### Mechanism Function

Interrupted systems may indicate:

- active mitigation attempt
- routine operation
- escalation effort

No textual fragment directly references a shutdown procedure.

---

## Translation Conflicts

Different translators prioritize different structures:

- literal wording
- metaphorical meaning
- procedural implication

Parallel translations are retained without hierarchy.

---

## Editorial Policy

When two interpretations remain equally supported:

Both remain published.

When evidence contradicts prior entries:

Earlier versions are preserved in context rather than replaced.
