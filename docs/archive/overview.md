# Archive Overview

**Document type:** Institutional description  
**Archive designation:** KKA-ARCH-001

---

## Purpose

The **Kākāriki Atoll Archive** is a compiled record of observations, materials, and textual fragments recovered from the Kākāriki Atoll site complex.

The archive does not present a single narrative of the site.  
Its role is to preserve recorded evidence while retaining disagreement where interpretation remains uncertain.

Where possible, entries distinguish between:

- direct observation
- inferred function
- speculative interpretation

No attempt is made to harmonize conflicting conclusions.

---

## Scope of Collection

The archive includes:

- geological and environmental surveys
- structural documentation
- artifact catalogs
- inscription fragments
- deposition records
- later analytical commentary

Materials are organized by evidence type rather than chronological sequence.

---

## Terminology Policy

Site terminology follows the most consistently attested terms found in recovered inscriptions when available.

Where no original term exists, neutral descriptive naming is used.  
Names do not imply confirmed cultural meaning.

Example: a structure may retain a traditional name while its function remains unverified.

---

## Interpretation Standards

The archive operates under three principles:

1. Preservation over conclusion  
2. Context over reconstruction  
3. Transparency over certainty

Contributors record observations even when they contradict existing models.

---

## Editorial Position

The archive is not a historical narrative, memorial, or cultural reconstruction.  
It is a record of material presence.

Statements describing belief, intent, or identity are treated as provisional unless supported by multiple independent evidence types.

---

## Reader Guidance

Readers are encouraged to approach the collection non-linearly.  
Understanding emerges through comparison between entries rather than through a single explanatory source.

Conflicting interpretations are expected and retained intentionally.
