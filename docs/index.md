# Kākāriki Atoll Archive

_A recovered-site dossier compiled from surveys, fragments, and later observations._

> **Working assumption:** the Kākāriki Atoll represents an abandoned island complex following a rapid ash-fall catastrophe.  
> **Important note:** later entries document activity inconsistent with total abandonment.

## Purpose of this archive

The **Kākāriki Atoll Archive** documents an isolated volcanic atoll and the culture complex once associated with it.

Entries preserve:

- observed physical evidence
- translated fragments
- conflicting interpretations
- unresolved phenomena

---

## Recommended reading order

For first time readers, the archive is best approached gradually:

1. **The land itself**  
   → [Geography of the Kākāriki Atoll](site/geography.md)

2. **Constructed objects**  
   → [Material Culture Index](material-culture/index.md)

3. **Recovered texts**  
   → [Texts and Recitations](texts/index.md)

4. **Interpretations**  
   → [Cosmology and Models](cosmology/index.md)

5. **The catastrophe**  
   → [Collapse Records](collapse/index.md)

6. **After the silence**  
   → [Ecology](ecology/index.md)

7. **Unresolved observations**  
   → [Anomalies](anomalies/index.md)

## Reading notes

Each article contains a **Confidence** level:

- **High** — directly observed
- **Moderate** — repeated but incomplete observation
- **Low** — interpretation or fragmentary translation

The archive favors layered understanding over certainty.
