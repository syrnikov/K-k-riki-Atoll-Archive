# Coral-Glass Remains

**Document type:** Material anomaly record  
**Archive designation:** KKA-MAT-005  
**Confidence:** High for material presence; Low–Moderate for origin

## Overview

**Coral-Glass Remains** are translucent fused masses found along lagoon margins, reef shelves, and occasionally inland near stone structures.  
The material resembles melted coral or sand vitrified into glass, yet appears in shapes inconsistent with typical lightning or lava contact formations.

Unlike obsidian fragments, these remains are rounded, layered, and often partially embedded within sediment.

Their formation temperature appears lower than full volcanic melt yet higher than natural reef cementation processes.

## Physical Characteristics

Typical features:

- pale green to milky white coloration
- layered translucency
- trapped air bubbles
- smooth outer surfaces with internal striations

The material fractures bluntly rather than sharply.

Some pieces contain preserved coral lattice patterns suspended inside the glass matrix.

---

## Distribution

Commonly found in:

- lagoon shallows
- sheltered reef breaks
- near certain platform edges
- drainage paths from interior slopes

Rarely present in high-energy surf zones.

In several locations, fragments form clusters as if material cooled in place rather than washed ashore.

---

## Formation Theories

Proposed explanations:

1. **Steam-Heat Fusion**  
   Superheated vapor interacting with wet coral substrate.

2. **Ash-Thermal Interaction**  
   Hot ash layers causing partial vitrification during deposition.

3. **Artificial Heating**  
   Controlled heating of marine material for unknown purpose.

4. **Lightning Vitrification**  
   Electrical discharge melting localized reef areas.

None fully explains inland occurrences away from marine water.

## Structural Context

Inland specimens appear near:

- drainage channels
- lava tube openings
- copper vein crossings

The material sometimes lines shallow depressions as if fluid before cooling.

## Surface Weathering

Despite exposure to salt and moisture, coral-glass degrades slowly.

Observed changes:

| Condition | Result |
|------|------|
| immersion | slight clouding |
| air exposure | stable |
| abrasion | dulling but not crumbling |
| heat | minimal alteration |

The durability differs from standard coral limestone.

## Interpretive Notes

Some fragments occur adjacent to ash-covered objects whose surfaces show similar thermal alteration.  
This suggests the same event may have affected organic and mineral materials simultaneously.

However, the controlled appearance of certain deposits complicates a purely catastrophic explanation.

---

## Open Questions

1. What temperature range created partial but not complete melting?
2. Why do some deposits occur far from the lagoon?
3. Were the remains a byproduct of environmental processes or intentional heating?
4. Do coral-glass layers correspond to the final ash event or earlier activity?
