# Moss Shrines

**Document type:** Feature catalog and usage hypothesis  
**Archive designation:** KKA-MAT-003  
**Confidence:** High for physical characteristics; Low for function

## Overview

**Moss Shrines** are small recessed stone features distributed across the Kākāriki Atoll, typically found along transitional zones: path edges, tube entrances, ridge crossings, and platform approaches.

Unlike the Stone Watchers, they are not visually prominent.  
Many remain unnoticed until vegetation is carefully parted, after which their construction becomes evident.

Their defining trait is persistent plant growth limited to the interior surface.

---

## Physical Structure

Common characteristics:

- shallow niche or alcove cut into stone
- flat base surface
- partial overhead cover
- facing outward toward open space

Average size allows for objects to be placed but not stored in volume.

No two shrines are identical, yet proportions remain consistent across the atoll.

---

## Vegetation Behavior

The interior of each shrine contains dense moss growth even where surrounding surfaces remain bare.

Observed properties:

| Condition | Observation |
|------|------|
| dry season | moss remains hydrated |
| heavy rain | no runoff pooling |
| disturbance | regrowth returns to original boundary |
| shading | not required for persistence |

The plant boundary forms a sharply defined edge that rarely spreads beyond the carved recess.

## Associated Objects

Small items are frequently found within or immediately adjacent to shrines:

- seeds
- shells
- smoothed stones
- fragments of fiber or leaves

These items appear intentionally placed rather than accumulated by water or animals.

No large storage deposits have been recorded.

---

## Spatial Distribution

Shrines commonly appear in locations requiring a decision:

- before entering confined spaces
- where paths divide
- at elevation changes
- near water access points

They rarely occur in open central areas.

---

## Evidence of Repetition

Disturbed shrines tend to return to a similar state:

- moss regrows within defined boundaries
- debris accumulates in similar patterns
- new small objects appear over time

Whether this indicates environmental stability or repeated visitation remains unresolved.

---

## Interpretive Theories

Proposed explanations include:

1. **Offerings Sites**  
   Locations where items were placed to mark passage or request protection.

2. **Boundary Markers**  
   Points acknowledging transition between safe and hazardous zones.

3. **Moisture Regulators**  
   Environmental control features using plant retention.

4. **Memory Markers**  
   Places for acknowledging movement through the landscape rather than worship.

No single theory accounts for all examples.

---

## Relationship to Other Structures

Shrines frequently appear near:

- lava tube entrances
- Stone Watcher sightlines
- corridor intersections
- copper vein crossings

Their placement suggests interaction with movement rather than habitation.

---

## Open Questions

1. Why does moss growth remain confined to carved boundaries?
2. Are placed objects symbolic, practical, or incidental?
3. Why do shrines cluster at decision points?
4. Does activity continue after the ash deposition layer?
