# Obsidian Fragments

**Document type:** Material distribution record  
**Archive designation:** KKA-MAT-004  
**Confidence:** High for material identification; Moderate for deposition context

## Overview

**Obsidian Fragments** are sharp volcanic glass pieces found across multiple zones of the Kākāriki Atoll.  
While volcanic glass naturally forms during rapid cooling of lava, the fragments at this site appear in repeated, localized concentrations rather than uniform dispersal.

Their distribution does not fully correspond to known lava flow boundaries from Mount Ahi.

## Physical Characteristics

Common properties:

- glossy black to deep green coloration
- razor-sharp fracture edges
- conchoidal break patterns
- thin flake-like shapes

Fragments range from fingertip-sized shards to blade-length splinters.

Many edges remain unusually unworn despite exposure conditions that typically dull glass quickly.

---

## Distribution Patterns

Fragments occur most often in:

- interior corridors
- caldera slopes
- near certain Stone Watchers
- entrances to subsurface chambers

They are rarely found scattered randomly across open forest floor.

In some locations fragments appear partially embedded into compacted surfaces rather than resting on top.

---

## Layer Relationship

In several excavated contexts, fragments appear:

- above pre-existing walking surfaces
- below ash deposition
- within ash deposition
- above ash deposition

This suggests multiple events of fragmentation rather than a single eruption phase.

## Possible Formation Sources

Proposed mechanisms:

1. **Eruptive Ejection**  
   Explosive activity producing airborne glass.

2. **Intentional Knapping**  
   Human shaping for tools or cutting edges.

3. **Thermal Shattering**  
   Heated rock fractured by rapid cooling.

4. **Structural Failure**  
   Glass-like surfaces breaking from heat-channel systems.

No single explanation fits all fragment contexts.

## Edge Wear Analysis

Microscopic inspection shows mixed patterns:

| Pattern | Interpretation |
|------|------|
| clean edges | recently fractured |
| polished micro-scratches | repeated handling |
| soot residue | exposure to flame |
| mineral crust | long-term exposure |

This combination indicates both natural and non-natural processes over time.

## Hazards

Certain paths remain hazardous due to fragment density.  
The fragments are sharp enough to cut footwear and skin.

The persistence of such hazards along navigable routes raises questions about whether they were avoided, tolerated, or intentionally maintained.

---

## Interpretive Notes

Some textual fragments reference “black teeth in the ground” or “walking where the earth bites.”  
Whether these refer to obsidian deposits or metaphorical warnings is uncertain.

---

## Open Questions

1. Why do fragments concentrate along movement routes?
2. Were fragments tools, waste, or byproducts of another process?
3. Why do some shards appear embedded into walking surfaces?
4. Do post-ash fragments indicate later activity?
