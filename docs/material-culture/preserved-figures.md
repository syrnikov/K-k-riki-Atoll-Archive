# Preserved Figures

**Document type:** Catastrophic context record  
**Archive designation:** KKA-MAT-006  
**Confidence:** High for physical occurrence; Moderate for interpretation

## Overview

The **Preserved Figures** are life-scale forms found fixed within the consolidated ash deposits distributed across the Kākāriki Atoll.  
They appear to represent individuals halted during ordinary activity at the moment of rapid ash deposition.

Unlike skeletal burials, the figures are not interred — they remain positioned where they stood.

Their preservation resembles natural casting processes observed in rapid burial events, though several details diverge from expected patterns.

## Physical Characteristics

Common properties:

- hollow internal cavities beneath hardened exterior shell
- surface texture preserving fabric, fiber, and hair impressions
- limb positions mid-motion rather than arranged
- variable posture (standing, reaching, turning, seated)

Many figures lack surviving organic material inside the casts.

The surrounding ash layer is compact and uniform.

---

## Distribution

Figures are found across multiple activity zones:

- pathways
- near mechanical features
- beside Stone Watchers
- inside structures
- within lava tube entrances

They are notably absent from sheltered deep tube chambers.

No centralized accumulation area has been identified.

## Behavioral Evidence

The preserved postures indicate interruption rather than preparation:

| Position | Possible Action |
|------|------|
| extended arms | reaching or shielding |
| bent knees | turning or bracing |
| seated forms | stationary task |
| clustered individuals | group interaction |

Several figures appear to face Mount Ahi at the time of deposition, though not universally.

## Associated Objects

Objects found in contact with figures include:

- tools or fragments
- containers
- worked materials
- unfinished constructions

No defensive arrangements or organized evacuation formations have been confirmed.

---

## Deposition Characteristics

The ash layer surrounding figures shows:

- fine particle density
- minimal layering within main deposit
- rapid compaction

The preservation quality suggests a fast-moving, high-volume event rather than gradual accumulation.

However, burn damage is less extensive than expected for high-temperature pyroclastic flows.

---

## Anomalous Observations

Several figures contain unusual traits:

- handprints impressed into nearby surfaces
- objects held but not dropped
- footprints extending only a short distance before termination

In rare cases, casts appear partially cleared around the head area after burial.

The cause remains undetermined.

---

## Interpretive Context

The figures indicate the atoll’s organized activity ceased abruptly.

The absence of prepared shelters or migration routes suggests either:

- no warning,
- ignored warning,
- or a misunderstood threat.

No written record describing the event has yet been confirmed.

## Open Questions

1. Why are deep subsurface areas empty of preserved individuals?
2. Were inhabitants attempting to flee or continue routine tasks?
3. What produced preservation without extensive burn damage?
4. Do post-burial disturbances indicate later visitation?
