# Mount Ahi (Central Caldera)

**Document type:** Geological and structural survey  
**Archive designation:** KKA-SITE-002  
**Confidence:** High for morphology and thermal behavior; Moderate for human modification hypotheses

## Overview

**Mount Ahi** is the central volcanic cone of the Kākāriki Atoll and the dominant topographic feature visible above the canopy.  
The name _Ahi_ (“fire”) appears in later textual fragments and is adopted here for consistency of reference; earlier survey logs refer to the formation simply as _the cone_.

The structure consists of a partially collapsed stratovolcanic cone enclosing a caldera basin with intermittent thermal activity.  
Ash composition, lava morphology, and distribution patterns indicate multiple eruptive phases separated by long quiescent intervals.

The final major ash event is associated with the termination of organized activity across the atoll (see: _Ash Layer_).

## Physical Description

**Height:** highest point of the atoll  
**Structure:** broken cone surrounding a shallow basin  
**Material:** basaltic and andesitic layers with tuff deposits

The outer slopes are steep and heavily vegetated except along several exposed ridgelines where regrowth is consistently thinner.  
These ridgelines form natural ascent routes and have been repeatedly noted as unusually stable compared to adjacent terrain.

The caldera interior contains:

- fumarolic vents
- warm mineral pools
- layered ash deposits
- vitrified rock surfaces

Certain surfaces display smoothing inconsistent with purely explosive formation.

---

## Thermal Activity

Mount Ahi remains geothermally active at a low level.

Observed phenomena:

- warm air currents exiting subsurface cracks
- periodic condensation inside nearby tube entrances
- mineral staining consistent with long-term vapor release
- faint rhythmic temperature fluctuations in interior chambers

The fluctuations do not follow simple tidal or diurnal cycles.

> Survey note: The temperature oscillations are subtle but persistent, suggesting a regulated heat exchange rather than random venting.

## The Caldera Basin

The basin floor is irregular and partially overgrown.  
Scattered obsidian and welded ash layers indicate rapid cooling events.

Several shallow depressions retain heat longer than surrounding rock.  
No magma is visible at surface level; heat transfer appears indirect.

Stone distributions around the basin edge form partial arcs at repeating intervals.  
Whether these represent natural collapse terraces or deliberate placement remains disputed.

---

## Subsurface Connections

Multiple lava-tube entrances occur along the interior slopes.  
Airflow patterns confirm an interconnected chamber network beneath the mountain.

Characteristics:

- stable internal temperature zones
- soot traces beyond likely wildfire penetration
- smoothed walking surfaces in certain corridors

The relationship between the caldera and the broader tube system suggests intentional access routes may have existed, though erosion alone cannot be ruled out.

---

## The Ash Event

A continuous ash layer radiates outward from Mount Ahi across all surveyed islets.

Properties:

- uniform thickness relative to distance from cone
- embedded human-position artifacts (see: _Final Positions_)
- halted mechanical configurations beneath deposits

The evidence indicates a rapid deposition event rather than prolonged fallout.

No signs of organized evacuation routes have been confirmed.

---

## Orientation Phenomena

Several large stone figures elsewhere on the atoll face toward Mount Ahi.  
Others face away.  
A subset appears to have been reoriented after the ash deposition layer.

The volcano may have functioned as a central reference point: geographic, cultural, or both. though no single interpretation explains all alignments.

---

## Current Stability

The volcano shows no indication of imminent large eruption based on:

- low gas emission volume
- consistent minor thermal output
- lack of seismic fracturing

However, localized collapses and heat bursts occur unpredictably within subsurface cavities.

Access to the interior basin remains hazardous.

## Open Questions

1. Were ascent ridgelines modified for repeated traversal?
2. Why do certain internal surfaces remain clear of heavy lichen growth?
3. Do the thermal pulses originate from natural convection alone?
4. What caused the uniform cessation of activity across the atoll immediately following the ash event?
