# Lava Tubes

**Document type:** Subsurface survey record  
**Archive designation:** KKA-SITE-003  
**Confidence:** High for mapped passages; Moderate for usage interpretation

## Overview

The Kākāriki Atoll contains an extensive network of **lava tubes and connected chambers** originating from eruptive phases of Mount Ahi.  
These void systems extend beneath multiple islets and, in several locations, open directly to the lagoon or sea-facing cliffs.

While lava-tube systems are common in volcanic islands, the Kākāriki network is notable for its **continuity, accessibility, and repeated surface integration**.

Certain passages exhibit wear patterns inconsistent with purely natural formation.

---

## Formation

The tubes likely formed when exterior lava flows cooled and solidified while molten material continued draining internally, leaving hollow conduits.

Typical features present:

- smooth basaltic walls
- flow shelves (“benches”)
- ceiling drip formations
- skylights formed by collapse

However, some passages differ from expected morphology:

- flattened floor segments
- widened choke points
- stone displacement near entrances

The origin of these modifications remains disputed.

---

## Major Zones

### Upper Vent Tubes

Located near the slopes of Mount Ahi.

Characteristics:

- warmer air temperatures
- mineral deposits around cracks
- intermittent condensation

Several upper tubes connect directly to the caldera basin.

---

### Mid-Level Passages

The most traversable and continuous segments.

Features:

- relatively even floors
- recurring soot traces
- branching intersections at regular intervals

These passages form the primary navigable network across the atoll interior.

---

### Coastal Openings

Where tubes meet erosion zones.

Observed:

- tidal airflow cycles
- salt crystal deposits
- occasional marine life presence

Some entrances appear naturally widened; others appear cleared.

## Environmental Conditions

The tubes maintain stable interior climates:

| Factor      | Observation                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Temperature | Moderately warm, consistent                  |
| Humidity    | High but non-condensing in certain corridors |
| Airflow     | Directional and persistent                   |
| Light       | Minimal except at skylights                  |

Several chambers remain dry even during heavy rainfall, suggesting deliberate drainage or highly efficient natural ventilation.

---

## Evidence of Use

Investigators have recorded the following:

- soot residues beyond wildfire penetration distance
- smoothed floor wear in narrow corridors
- repeated turning points near vertical shafts
- stacked stones near junctions

None individually confirms habitation, but the combination suggests repeated passage over extended time.

Notably, certain paths connect key surface structures with minimal elevation change.

---

## Acoustic Properties

Sound carries unusually far in specific corridors.  
Low voices can be heard around bends where direct line-of-sight is blocked.

This has led to competing theories:

- communication aid
- ritual acoustics
- coincidence of geometry

No consensus exists.

---

## Thermal Behavior

Temperature gradients shift subtly across the network.

Warm air flows outward from interior sections during cooler external conditions and reverses weakly during hotter periods.  
The pattern implies deep heat reservoirs interacting with surface air exchange.

A small number of chambers show rhythmic warming independent of daily cycles.

---

## Hazards

Primary risks include:

- ceiling collapse in fractured zones
- low-oxygen pockets
- concealed vertical drops
- sudden steam vents

Several collapses appear older than the ash layer, while others cut through it.

---

## Open Questions

1. Were certain corridors intentionally cleared or stabilized?
2. Why do some passages connect distant structures directly?
3. Are soot traces domestic, industrial, or natural?
4. Do acoustic chambers indicate planned gathering spaces?
