# Tagoror Circles

**Document type:** Structural survey record  
**Archive designation:** KKA-SITE-006  
**Confidence:** High for structure and placement; Low–Moderate for function

## Overview

The **Tagoror Circles** are circular or oval stepped stone enclosures located primarily on elevated interior terraces of the Kākāriki Atoll.  
They are among the few structures not concealed by vegetation and are typically positioned where surrounding terrain provides wide visibility.

The term *Tagoror* is adopted from later textual references describing “He kōpae tiketike, i reira ngā reo e kōpuni ana," _(high circles where voices meet,)_ though the connection between name and structure remains interpretive.

## Physical Description

Common characteristics:

- circular or slightly oval layout
- low stepped seating tiers
- central open ground
- narrow entrance gap aligned with surrounding landscape

Diameters vary but proportions remain consistent across sites.

The stonework is carefully fitted yet lacks decorative carving.

---

## Construction Features

Observed construction details:

| Feature | Observation |
|------|------|
| tier height | uniform and human-scale |
| interior floor | compacted and smoothed |
| entrance | single opening, no gate fixtures |
| drainage | subtle outward slope |

No roof supports or post holes have been identified.

The structures appear intentionally open to sky and wind.

---

## Spatial Context

Tagoror Circles occur in specific locations:

- ridgelines overlooking multiple zones
- junctions between inland routes
- near but not directly beside Stone Watchers

They are absent from densely enclosed forest interiors.

In several cases, pathways converge toward the entrance gap.

---

## Acoustic Properties

Sound behaves distinctly within the circles:

- speech from center carries outward clearly
- external noise diminishes toward interior
- echoes are minimal despite stone surfaces

These properties suggest intentional shaping of the enclosure geometry.

---

## Associated Finds

Nearby materials include:

- scattered stone fragments
- ash layer undisturbed within seating tiers
- occasional small object deposits at entrance

No permanent fixtures or large storage remains were discovered.

## Interpretive Theories

Proposed uses:

1. **Assembly Space**  
   Area for gathering and discussion.

2. **Ritual Platform**  
   Ceremonial activity linked to surrounding structures.

3. **Acoustic Signaling Site**  
   Communication across distance.

4. **Observation Point**  
   Monitoring environmental changes.

No single explanation fully accounts for all placements.

## Relationship to Other Features

Tagoror Circles often align with:

- sightlines toward Mount Ahi
- corridor approaches
- moss shrine proximity

They rarely occur in isolation from other site features.

---

## Open Questions

1. Why do entrances face different directions between circles?
2. Were gatherings periodic or continuous?
3. Do acoustic properties indicate speech, chant, or signaling?
4. Why is vegetation slower to reclaim interior surfaces?
