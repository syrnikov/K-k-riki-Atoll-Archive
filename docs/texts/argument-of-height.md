# Argument of Height

**Document type:** Disputed discourse fragment  
**Archive designation:** KKA-TXT-003  
**Confidence:** Low (fragmentary and internally contradictory)

---

## Overview

The **Argument of Height** consists of several inscribed fragments discovered near upland construction zones and collapsed terraces.  
Unlike the recitations, the text lacks rhythmic structure and contains abrupt tonal shifts, suggesting recorded speech during disagreement rather than formal instruction.

Multiple writing styles appear within the same fragments, possibly indicating more than one speaker.

The text centers repeatedly on the concept of *te tiketike*: height, elevation, or raising, though its exact meaning varies by context.

## Fragment A

> “E piki ana tātou kia kite atu ai.”  
> _(We rise so that we may see farther.)_

Followed immediately by:

> “Ka piki rawa, ka ngaro te rongo.”  
> _(If we rise too much, the listening is lost.)_

Researchers interpret this as either architectural or philosophical dispute.

---

## Fragment B

> “Kaua e whakatū kia rangona te ao.”  
> _(Do not build so the world hears us.)_

Alternative translation:

> “Do not raise structures for the sake of being noticed.”

The ambiguity of *rangona* allows both acoustic and social interpretation.

## Fragment C

> “He iti te noho ora i raro, he nui te hiahia i runga.”  
> _(Life is steady below; desire is greater above.)_

Often cited in discussions of pre-collapse behavioral change.

---

## Fragment D (damaged)

> “Kua rongo koutou i te kupu mō te ahi… engari kei te hiahia tonu koutou kia tere ake.”  
> _(You have heard the word about the fire… yet you still wish it to be faster.)_

The following lines are missing.

## Structural Notes

Distinct from earlier texts:

- sentences interrupt one another
- opposing statements appear sequentially
- no closing resolution survives

This suggests the record may have been a transcription rather than a prepared inscription.

---

## Interpretive Context

Two main readings exist:

1. **Construction Debate**  
   Discussion over building taller structures or expanding beyond traditional limits.

2. **Operational Escalation Debate**  
   Disagreement over increasing the intensity or speed of a system linked to heat or energy.

Both correlate with later evidence of unfinished large-scale works.

---

## Cultural Implication

The presence of disagreement implies organized decision-making rather than uniform doctrine.  
The fragments represent one of the few textual sources showing internal division.

---

## Open Questions

1. What specifically was being raised — structures, output, or influence?
2. Why was the record preserved near construction areas?
3. Did the disagreement occur shortly before the ash event?
4. Does “losing the listening” refer to environmental signals being ignored?
