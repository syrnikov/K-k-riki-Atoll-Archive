# Green Fragments

**Document type:** Partial inscription record  
**Archive designation:** KKA-TXT-001  
**Confidence:** Low–Moderate (fragmentary; translation disputed)

## Overview

The **Green Fragments** are a collection of inscribed stone slabs and broken tablets recovered from interior ridge zones and near several Tagoror Circles.

The inscriptions are shallow and heavily weathered.  
Most fragments preserve only partial lines.

The recurring term *kākāriki* appears frequently, though its contextual meaning varies between passages.

## Physical Characteristics

- shallow linear incision
- repeated curved motifs
- minimal decorative framing
- no named authors

Fragments are typically found face-down beneath ash or soil layers.

No complete tablet has been recovered.

## Fragment I

Inscription (partial):

> “He kākāriki te whenua, kāore i te mea nō te tangata.”  
> _(The land is green; it is not a thing belonging to people.)_

Alternative translation:

> “The vitality of the land is not possessed by those who stand upon it.”

Debate centers on whether *kākāriki* refers to color, vitality, or condition.

---

## Fragment II

Inscription (damaged):

> “Ka rere te wera i raro, ka ora te mata i runga.”  
> _(When heat moves below, the surface lives above.)_

Some researchers interpret this as a geothermal observation.  
Others argue it reflects metaphorical balance between hidden and visible systems.

---

## Fragment III

Inscription (incomplete ending):

> “Kaua e tere ake i te mauri…”  
> _(Do not move faster than the life-force…)_

The remainder of the sentence is missing.

This fragment is often cited in discussions of collapse behavior.

## Linguistic Notes

The writing system appears phonetic and consistent with later reconstructed forms of the language used in recitations.

However:

- some grammatical constructions are archaic
- certain compound words do not appear in later texts
- repetition suggests oral-origin transcription

The fragments likely represent recorded speech rather than formal law.

---

## Recurring Themes

Across fragments:

- references to *mauri* (life-force / animating principle)
- repeated mention of *raro* (below) and *runga* (above)
- avoidance of ownership terminology
- warnings framed as tempo rather than morality

The tone is instructive but not authoritarian.

## Interpretive Disagreement

Two major schools of thought exist:

1. **Ecological Doctrine Model**  
   The fragments reflect environmental management principles.

2. **Energy-System Model**  
   The language encodes operational constraints for geothermal or mechanical systems.

The overlap between metaphor and engineering complicates classification.

## Open Questions

1. Were these fragments instructional, ceremonial, or philosophical?
2. Why are they found near elevated discussion sites?
3. Does *kākāriki* describe vegetation, vitality, or a social identity?
4. Were the fragments recorded shortly before the ash event?
