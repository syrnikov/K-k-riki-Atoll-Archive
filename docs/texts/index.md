## Overview

This section catalogs all recovered written material associated with the Kākāriki Atoll site.

The inscriptions vary in form and reliability:

- prepared carvings
- partial tablets
- informal markings
- surface incisions

No complete written record has been recovered.  
All texts exist as fragments or overlapping reconstructions.

The writing appears derived from spoken language rather than formal literary tradition.

## Classification of Text Groups

### Foundational Fragments
Short declarative statements recorded on portable or broken stone surfaces.

- [Green Fragments](green-fragments.md)

These texts contain recurring conceptual terms and are considered the earliest preserved written material.

---

### Recited Material
Rhythmic lines likely transcribed from repeated speech.

- [Three Fires Recitations](three-fires-recitations.md)

The structure suggests memorized oral transmission rather than composed literature.

---

### Dispute Records
Non-rhythmic inscriptions showing opposing statements.

- [Argument of Height](argument-of-height.md)
- [Late Circle Debates](late-circle-debates.md)

These represent the only known examples of recorded disagreement.

## Translation Notes

Interpretations differ significantly depending on linguistic assumptions.  
Parallel translation frameworks are maintained:

- [Translator A](translation-notes/translator-a.md)
- [Translator B](translation-notes/translator-b.md)
- [Translator C](translation-notes/translator-c.md)

No single translation is treated as definitive.

## Writing Characteristics

Common features across inscriptions:

- economy of wording
- absence of personal names
- relational terminology
- preference for verbs over nouns

The texts rarely describe objects directly; they describe interactions.

---

## Limitations

The surviving record is incomplete.  
Order of composition cannot be confirmed, and multiple fragments may represent overlapping time periods.

Interpretations should be read as provisional.
