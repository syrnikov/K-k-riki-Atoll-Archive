**Confidence:** Low–Moderate (context inferred from location)

## Overview

The **Late Circle Debates** are a series of short inscriptions carved directly into the seating tiers of several Tagoror Circles.  
Unlike the earlier tablets, these markings appear informal and uneven, suggesting they were recorded during or shortly after spoken discussion rather than prepared beforehand.

The writing frequently overlaps, and lines interrupt one another.  
Some inscriptions are shallow and hesitant; others deeply incised.

The fragments appear to document an ongoing dispute rather than a single event.

## Fragment Sequence A

> “Kua rerekē ngā tohu, kāore te whenua e whakahoki kupu.”  
> _(The signs have changed, the land no longer answers.)_

Followed nearby by:

> “Kei te whakahoki tonu, engari kāore tātou e whakarongo.”  
> _(It still answers, but we are no longer listening.)_

---

## Fragment Sequence B

> “Kaua e whakatere i te wera, waiho kia haere pēnei me mua.”  
> _(Do not hasten the heat, let it move as before.)_

Counter-inscription:

> “Ki te kore e tere, ka ngoikore tātou.”  
> _(If it does not move faster, we weaken.)_

---

## Fragment Sequence C

> “Ehara te tiketike i te kaha.”  
> _(Height is not strength.)_

Placed adjacent:

> “Engari mā te tiketike ka ora ai.”  
> _(But by height we will survive.)_

---

## Fragment Sequence D

> “Kua mutu te wā whakarongo.”  
> _(The time for listening has ended.)_

The line appears deeper and later than surrounding inscriptions.

## Structural Characteristics

- inscriptions follow seating arcs rather than central focal points
- statements positioned facing one another across the circle
- no final declaration or resolution preserved

This spatial arrangement suggests opposing speakers occupied different positions within the circle.

---

## Temporal Placement

Ash deposits partially fill the lower carvings while upper markings remain exposed, indicating multiple writing phases shortly before deposition.

The debates likely occurred near the end of sustained activity on the atoll.

---

## Interpretive Themes

Recurring subjects:

- accelerating or restraining heat
- raising or limiting structures
- responding to environmental signals
- urgency versus caution

The tone shifts from advisory to insistent across later markings.

## Open Questions

1. Did the debates represent leadership councils or open gatherings?
2. Were the inscriptions made during the discussions or afterward?
3. Does the change in carving depth reflect emotional intensity or time sequence?
4. Did any agreement occur before the ash event?
