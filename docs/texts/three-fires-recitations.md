# Three Fires Recitations

**Document type:** Oral transcription fragments  
**Archive designation:** KKA-TXT-002  
**Confidence:** Low–Moderate (poetic structure; multiple translations possible)

## Overview

The **Three Fires Recitations** are fragments of repeated verse recovered from stone surfaces near Tagoror Circles and interior pathways.  
Unlike the Green Fragments, the lines follow rhythmic patterns suggesting they were spoken aloud before being inscribed.

The text refers repeatedly to *ngā ahi e toru* — three fires — though the term appears metaphorical rather than describing literal flame.

No complete recitation survives; the following passages represent reconstructed sequences from overlapping fragments.

---

## Passage A

> “E toru ngā ahi e mau ai te ao:  
> ko te ahi raro, ko te ahi runga, ko te ahi haere.”  
> _(Three fires hold the world:  
> the fire below, the fire above, the fire that moves.)_

Some researchers interpret this as cosmological layering.  
Others associate the categories with environmental processes (subsurface heat, sun exposure, and circulation).

---

## Passage B

> “Ki te kaha rawa tētahi, ka ngoikore ērā atu.”  
> _(If one grows too strong, the others weaken.)_

Often cited in relation to imbalance theories following the ash event.

---

## Passage C

> “Ehara te ahi i te kai, ehara i te hoa;  
> he āhua anake e tika ana kia taurite.”  
> _(Fire is not food, nor companion;  
> it is a condition that must remain balanced.)_

Translation disputes center on whether *ahi* here refers to literal heat, social force, or an operational state.

---

## Passage D (fragmented)

> “Me noho te tangata hei kaiwhakarongo, kaua hei rangatira…”  
> _(People should remain listeners, not masters…)_

The final clause is missing.

## Structural Notes

The verses display features typical of memorized speech:

- repetition of key terms
- balanced phrasing
- minimal specific nouns
- emphasis on relationship rather than ownership

Line breaks align with breath intervals rather than written syntax.

## Interpretive Models

### Philosophical Balance Model
The recitations describe a worldview centered on equilibrium between interacting forces.

### Operational Constraint Model
The text encodes safety rules governing a system requiring constant moderation.

Both interpretations explain portions of the text; neither explains all.

## Relationship to Other Texts

Certain phrases mirror lines in the Green Fragments but appear simplified for speech.

Example:

> “Kaua e tere ake i te mauri”  
> _(Do not move faster than the life-force)_  
appears as  
> “Kaua e tere”  
> _(Do not hurry)_  
in recitation form.

## Open Questions

1. Were the Three Fires symbolic, physical, or procedural?
2. Why were the verses placed near gathering circles?
3. Did recitation serve teaching, warning, or coordination purposes?
4. Were these spoken regularly or only in response to specific conditions?
