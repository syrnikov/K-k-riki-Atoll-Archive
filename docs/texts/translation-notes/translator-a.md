# Translator A

**Document type:** Translation framework profile  
**Archive designation:** KKA-TXT-TR-A

---

## Approach

Translator A prioritizes **literal and ecological meaning**.  
Words are interpreted according to observable environmental processes unless direct contradiction occurs.

Metaphorical readings are avoided where a physical relationship can be identified.

The working assumption:

> The inscriptions describe how to live within the environment, not how to symbolize it.

---

## Linguistic Principles

Key translation preferences:

| Term | Preferred Meaning |
|------|------|
| ahi | heat or thermal state |
| mauri | sustaining condition of a system |
| raro | subsurface or internal layer |
| runga | exposed or surface layer |
| kākāriki | living or active landscape state |
| whakarongo | to detect or perceive signals |

Personification is treated as descriptive shorthand rather than spiritual reference.

## Example Readings

### Green Fragment

> “He kākāriki te whenua, kāore i te mea nō te tangata.”  
> _(The land is living; it is not a possession of people.)_

Interpretation:  
Human activity must adapt to environmental limits rather than impose ownership.

---

### Three Fires Recitation

> “E toru ngā ahi e mau ai te ao.”  
> _(Three thermal conditions maintain the world.)_

Interpretation:  
Three interacting heat processes stabilize the environment.

---

### Argument of Height

> “Ka piki rawa, ka ngaro te rongo.”  
> _(If raised too far, detection is lost.)_

Interpretation:  
Increasing scale reduces sensitivity to environmental feedback.

## Overall Model

Translator A interprets the texts as a **practical environmental protocol** describing:

- monitoring natural indicators
- maintaining equilibrium
- avoiding excessive extraction or acceleration

The culture is viewed as observational rather than symbolic.

---

## Points of Disagreement

Translator A rejects:

- mythological readings
- ancestor worship assumptions
- ritual explanations without measurable effect

Where others see belief, this framework sees procedure.

---

## Limitations

This approach struggles to explain:

- repeated poetic structures
- non-functional phrasing
- inscriptions located in social gathering spaces

Some passages remain resistant to purely literal translation.
