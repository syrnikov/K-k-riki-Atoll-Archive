# Translator B

**Document type:** Translation framework profile  
**Archive designation:** KKA-TXT-TR-B

---

## Approach

Translator B treats the inscriptions as **technical language encoded in metaphor**.  
Rather than describing environment or belief, the texts are interpreted as operational guidance for maintaining a complex system.

The working assumption:

> The speakers already understood the mechanisms; the language served as a memory-safe method of transmitting procedures.

Metaphor is therefore not decorative, it is protective shorthand.

---

## Linguistic Principles

Key translation preferences:

| Term | Preferred Meaning |
|------|------|
| ahi | energy process or active system state |
| mauri | operating stability |
| raro | internal infrastructure layer |
| runga | external interface layer |
| kākāriki | optimal operating condition |
| whakarongo | monitoring or feedback measurement |

Human-centered language is interpreted as reference to system operators rather than symbolic actors.

## Example Readings

### Green Fragment

> “He kākāriki te whenua, kāore i te mea nō te tangata.”  
> _(The system remains stable; it is not controlled by its operators.)_

Interpretation:  
The system cannot be overridden, only maintained within parameters.

---

### Three Fires Recitation

> “E toru ngā ahi e mau ai te ao.”  
> _(Three active processes maintain the whole.)_

Interpretation:  
Three interacting subsystems regulate total function.

---

### Argument of Height

> “Kaua e whakatū kia rangona te ao.”  
> _(Do not increase output beyond detection threshold.)_

Interpretation:  
Scaling the system alters feedback reliability.

---

## Overall Model

Translator B views the culture as operators of an integrated environmental mechanism involving:

- heat transfer
- flow regulation
- stability thresholds

The recitations function as mnemonic safety rules rather than philosophy.

---

## Points of Disagreement

Translator B rejects:

- purely ecological readings
- purely symbolic interpretations
- the assumption that inscriptions describe daily life

Instead, daily life is seen as structured around maintaining infrastructure.

---

## Limitations

This model struggles to explain:

- emotional tone in debate inscriptions
- references to listening as social action
- object deposits at shrines

Not all passages behave like procedural instruction.
