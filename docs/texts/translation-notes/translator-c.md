## Approach

Translator C interprets the inscriptions as cultural and relational language.  
The texts are read as expressions of worldview, social behavior, and shared understanding rather than instruction or technical record.

Working assumption:

> The speakers were not describing systems, they were describing how a person should exist among other beings and forces.

Meaning is carried through metaphor intentionally, not as disguise.

## Linguistic Principles

Key translation preferences:

| Term | Preferred Meaning |
|------|------|
| ahi | driving influence, motivation, or impulse |
| mauri | presence or living essence |
| raro | what is hidden or internal |
| runga | what is visible or expressed |
| kākāriki | state of harmony or flourishing life |
| whakarongo | attentive awareness |

Environmental or mechanical readings are considered secondary to social meaning.

## Example Readings

### Green Fragment

> “He kākāriki te whenua, kāore i te mea nō te tangata.”  
> _(The land lives, it is not owned by people.)_

Interpretation:  
Identity exists within relationships, not possession.

---

### Three Fires Recitation

> “E toru ngā ahi e mau ai te ao.”  
> _(Three forces hold the world together.)_

Interpretation:  
Life remains stable through balance between impulses, not through control.

---

### Argument of Height

> “Ka piki rawa, ka ngaro te rongo.”  
> _(When raised too high, awareness is lost.)_

Interpretation:  
Ambition separates people from understanding their surroundings.

---

## Overall Model

Translator C views the culture as relational rather than technological.  
The inscriptions describe behavior expectations, restraint, and listening as social virtues.

The people did not maintain a system, they maintained a way of being.

---

## Points of Disagreement

Translator C rejects:

- purely technical instruction interpretations
- purely environmental survival manuals
- the assumption that metaphor hides procedure

Instead, procedure may have emerged from belief rather than the reverse.

---

## Limitations

This approach struggles to explain:

- repeated references to measurable conditions
- structured placement of inscriptions near functional structures
- apparent synchronization with physical processes

Some passages behave more operational than cultural.
